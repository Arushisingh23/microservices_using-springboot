# Microservices using  springboot  
Two microservices were created with the help of the spring boot framework.​​
The (light weight) database i.e. H2 ​has been used.​
The Eureka Server is used to keep track of all active clients, API gateways, and microservice instances that are currently running.​​
Dynamic scaling has been implemented with the aid of the Eureka naming server and an API gateway made using Spring Cloud Gateway.​​
Using Docker and Kubernetes, containerization and deployment have been carried out.​​
